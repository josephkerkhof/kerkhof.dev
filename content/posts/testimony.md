I was really fortunate to grow up in a Christian home where we went to church almost every weekend. Weeknights in childhood would be filled with church-related activities like Sonlight (a lot like Awana). My parents homeschooled me to have more time teaching me (but always had plenty of social interactions with others).

During one of the Sunday schools there was a speaker who laid out how that every one of us are sinners and that because we've sinned, deserve eternal destination separate from our Holy God in hell. But because God loved us, and wanted to make a way for us to be with him again, sent his son Jesus to take the punishment of our sin for us. Because of Jesus' sacrifice, we can be restored and be with God again.

Even ask a kid I knew that I was a sinner and that this was good news. I confessed my sins to God, and asked for Jesus to be my savior.

As I grew older, I continued my involvement in church going to Bible quiz, youth group, and mission trips. Each of these activities continued to plant seeds in my life and hide God's word in my heart. But as I grew older, my sinful nature also grew into new ways. I started struggling with what the Bible calls lust, and I cared about myself more than anyone else. I constantly disrespected my parents and rebelled against and fought with them. It was as if new sin had crept into my life, but that sin nature was always there, I just hadn't given it to God. In a sense, I was more important than God (and if I'm honest, I still struggle with self-idolatry).

In college is where I began to take more ownership of my faith transforming it from something my family did (and was) into something that was mine. I attended a Chi-Alpha at my university and fully surrendered my life to Christ again. I began to understand deeper concepts of how Christ's sacrifice for me justified my penalty of damnation, the role of the Holy Spirit in our life, and how that it is by *grace alone* that we are saved (not of works, so that no man can boast). God's own glory is the purpose for creating the world and that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.

I realized that although I was baptised as a baby in a Lutheran church, I had never made the decision to publicly declare myself that Christ was my savior. So one cold night in Winter I went down to the university pool during one of the Chi-Alpha nights and jumped in to be baptised by my best friend and declare to the public that Christ is my savior. What an awesome feeling that was!

I still struggle with sin every day and my sinful nature manifests itself in new, sometimes surprising, ways. But my creator is making me new through the reading of His Holy Word. He is always good, He always provides a way, and has given everything for us to be with Himself for eternety. To God be all glory and honor and dominion. May His kingdom dwell on earth as it is in heaven.

I am eternally grateful for God who has called me to himself by His grace alone. He can do the same for you too if you confess your sinsand repent (turn away from your old sins and towards a new life in Christ according to his rules).
