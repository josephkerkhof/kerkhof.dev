Hello, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joseph, a full-stack software engineer with a knack for using open source software to create human-centered experiences.

You won't find me chacing new, trendy tools. In my 8 years of experience, I've come to love mature, well-tested tools and frameworks. This is why I tend to lean towards PHP, Laravel, Linux (i use arch btw ðŸ’™), and (neo)vim. Not only are mature tools intrinsically valuable due to their stability, but the large community is what turbo-charges them.

At work, I love asynchronous work and remote teams. I have communication skills required to make this work in a distributed team. Jira? Slack hygiene? High quality PRs and PR reviews? Automating manual tasks? Documentation? I can do that. I know how to handle my work so that I rarely get blocked by just one thing. Engineering systems shouldn't have a single point of failure, and neither should my work load.

When it comes to development, it's not just about writing code. I have an eye for reducing tech debt, ensuring that the solutions I create are maintainable, efficient, and scalable for the long-term. By addressing technical challenges proactively, I help teams avoid pitfalls and deliver high-quality software. All software rots if it isn't maintained, that's why having a proactive strategy to stay in front of it is so important.

Do I sound like someone who you might want on your team? [Contact me](/contact) ðŸ˜„.
