Hello, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joseph, a full-stack software engineer by day ðŸ˜Ž, perpetual tinkerer by night ðŸ§°.

## Philosophy

You won't find me chasing new, trendy tools. I've come to love mature, well-tested, open source tools and frameworks - professionally and personally! In this way I tend to lean towards technologies like PHP, Laravel, Linux, and vim. Not only are mature tools valuable due to their stability, but their large communities are what turbo-charges them.

At work, I love asynchronous work and remote teams. I've been working 100% remotely since 2019. I have the communication skills required to make this work in a distributed team. Jira? Slack hygiene? High quality PRs and reviews? I can do that.

It's not just about writing code. I have an eye for reducing tech debt, ensuring the code I write is maintainable, efficient, and scalable. All software rots if it isn't maintained, that's why a proactive strategy is so important.

## Testimonials

"Today is Joseph's two-year anniversary with Clockwork. In that time, I've seen him excel as a software engineer. He's demonstrated a depth of expertise in LAMP stack web application development, content management systems (Craft, Drupal, WordPress), and building out a series of job portals on PageUp.

He's also shown a breadth of expertise by inspiring his team as a scrum master, teaching machine learning to other engineers, and most recently, leading a migration from Salesforce Pardot to HubSpot. Joseph sets an outstanding example for his peers and it's no a surprise why they love working with him. Thank you Joseph for all your contributions these past two years!"
