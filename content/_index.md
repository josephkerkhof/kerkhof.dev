Hello, nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joseph, full-stack software engineer with a knack for using open source software to create human-centered experiences.

You won't find me chacing new, trendy tools. In my 8 years of experience, I've come to love mature, well-tested tools. This is why I tend to lean towards PHP, Laravel, Linux (i use arch btw ðŸ’™), and (neo)vim. Not only are the tools valuable, but the size of the community is valuable as well.

At work, I love asynchronous and remote teams. I have communication skills required to make this work in a distributed team. Jira? Pipelines? Static code analysis? Documentation? I can do that.

When it comes to development, it's not just about writing code. I have a keen eye for reducing tech debt, ensuring that the solutions I create are maintainable, efficient, and scalable for the long-term. By addressing technical challenges proactively, I help teams avoid pitfalls and deliver high-quality software.
