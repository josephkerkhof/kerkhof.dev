The easiest way to reach me is by [email](mailto:joseph@kerkhof.dev).

You may send me an encrypted email using my GPG key which can be found [here](https://kerkhof.dev/josephkerkhof.gpg) or you can run:

```sh
curl -sL https://kerkhof.dev/josephkerkhof.gpg | gpg --import
```

My GPG key fingerprint: `51C7 FCE5 909B 5D1F 8081  3F06 71A6 96CA C91C EA76`

You may also find me on [Github](https://github.com/josephkerkhof) and [Nostr](ext+web+nostr:npub1ecf87gnuvnkqm3qdf720f6rpyy7kxqwjvkvdzvlm4y6s7vr3mzxqeq3spn). [Nostr](https://nostr.com) is a new kind of censorship-resistant protocol currently being used as a social media.
